This repository now includes a simple Streamlit application to refine text prompts.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The app allows you to enter any text and returns a cleaned-up version that is easier for ChatGPT to understand.
